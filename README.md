ObjectiveDDP
============
Connect your applications written in Objective-C to server applications that communicate with the [DDP protocol created by Meteor] and, if required by your server, authenticate with [SRP]. Out of the box, this library allows your iOS applications to communicate and authenticate with Meteor servers or any server using the DDP/SRP protocols.

Requirements
--------------
ObjectiveDDP should run well with iOS projects using ARC and iOS 6.0 or above. Check out the [example application](https://github.com/boundsj/ObjectiveDDP/wiki/Example-Application) and the [project wiki](https://github.com/boundsj/ObjectiveDDP/wiki) for more information.
